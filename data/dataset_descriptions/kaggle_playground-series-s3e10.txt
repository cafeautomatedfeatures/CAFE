Data can be useful for prediction models of classification.

COLUMNS:
Based on Integrated Profile of Observation

Mean_Integrated: Mean of Observations

SD: Standard deviation of Observations

EK: Excess kurtosis of Observations

Skewness: In probability theory and statistics, skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. Skewness of Observations.

Mean _ DMSNR _ Curve: Mean of DM SNR CURVE of Observations

SD _ DMSNR _ Curve: Standard deviation of DM SNR CURVE of Observations

EK _ DMSNR _ Curve: Excess kurtosis of DM SNR CURVE of Observations

Skewness _ DMSNR _ Curve: Skewness of DM SNR CURVE of Observations

Class: Class 0 - 1

WHAT IS DM SNR CURVE:

Radio waves emitted from pulsars reach earth after traveling long distances in space which is filled with free electrons. The important point is that pulsars emit a wide range of frequencies, and the amount by which the electrons slow down the wave depends on the frequency. Waves with higher frequency are sowed down less as compared to waves with higher frequency. It means dispersion.

TARGET:
