This dataset can be used to predict the presence of kidney stones based on urine analysis.

The 79 urine specimens, were analyzed in an effort to
determine if certain physical characteristics of the urine might be related to the
formation of calcium oxalate crystals.
The six physical characteristics of the urine are: (1) specific gravity, the density of the urine relative to water; (2) pH, the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion; (3) osmolarity (mOsm), a unit used in biology and medicine but not in
physical chemistry. Osmolarity is proportional to the concentration of
molecules in solution; (4) conductivity (mMho milliMho). One Mho is one
reciprocal Ohm. Conductivity is proportional to the concentration of charged
ions in solution; (5) urea concentration in millimoles per litre; and (6) calcium
concentration (CALC) in millimolesllitre.

The data is obtained from 'Physical Characteristics of Urines With and Without Crystals',a chapter from Springer Series in Statistics.
