Group A streptococcus (GAS) infection is a major cause of pediatric pharyngitis, and infection with this organism requires appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

There is controversy as to whether physicians can rely on signs and symptoms to select pediatric patients with pharyngitis who should undergo rapid antigen detection testing (RADT) for GAS .

Our objective was to evaluate the validity of signs and symptoms in the selective testing of children with pharyngitis.

Now, let's use machine learning to analyze whether a diagnosis can be made from the child's symptoms and signs.
Can we predict RADT positive?
