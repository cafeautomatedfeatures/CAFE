# FlightLengthCategory
# Usefulness: This feature categorizes the flight length into short, medium, and long-haul flights, which might be useful in predicting delays as different flight lengths might have different patterns of delays.
# Input samples: 'Length': [134.0, 244.0, 380.0]
def categorize_flight_length(length):
    if length < 200:
        return 0  # Short-haul
    elif 200 <= length < 500:
        return 1  # Medium-haul
    else:
        return 2  # Long-haul

df['FlightLengthCategory'] = df['Length'].apply(categorize_flight_length)
