# Feature name: strength_difference
# Usefulness: This feature calculates the difference in strength between the white and black pieces, which can be useful in determining the outcome of a potential capture.
# Input samples: 'white_piece0_strength': [5.0, 6.0, 0.0], 'black_piece0_strength': [6.0, 0.0, 0.0]
df['strength_difference'] = df['white_piece0_strength'] - df['black_piece0_strength']

# Feature name: stronger_piece
# Usefulness: This feature indicates which piece is stronger (1 for white, -1 for black, 0 for equal strength). This can help the classifier understand the balance of power between the two pieces.
# Input samples: 'white_piece0_strength': [5.0, 6.0, 0.0], 'black_piece0_strength': [6.0, 0.0, 0.0]
