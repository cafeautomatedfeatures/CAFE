# Feature name: "gravity_ph_product"
# Usefulness: Combining gravity and pH values can provide useful information about the urine environment, which might be related to the formation of calcium oxalate crystals.
# Input samples: 'gravity': [1.02, 1.02, 1.02], 'ph': [7.61, 5.56, 5.47]
df['gravity_ph_product'] = df['gravity'] * df['ph']
