# Insulin and Glucose Interaction
# Usefulness: Combining insulin and glucose levels may provide better insight into diabetes risk, as both are related to the body's ability to process glucose.
# Input samples: 'insu': [220.0, 0.0, 96.0], 'plas': [119.0, 107.0, 115.0]
df['insulin_glucose'] = df['insu'] * df['plas']

# Pregnancies and Age Interaction
# Usefulness: Combining the number of times pregnant and age may help the classifier identify patterns related to diabetes risk, as older women with more pregnancies could be at higher risk.
# Input samples: 'preg': [1.0, 0.0, 1.0], 'age': [29.0, 23.0, 32.0]
df['pregnancies_age'] = df['preg'] * df['age']
