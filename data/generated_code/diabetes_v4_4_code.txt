# Insulin Glucose Interaction
# Usefulness: Insulin and glucose levels are directly related to diabetes risk. Their interaction term can help capture this relationship.
# Input samples: 'insu': [155.0, 65.0, 0.0], 'plas': [129.0, 86.0, 151.0]
df['insulin_glucose_interaction'] = df['insu'] * df['plas']

# Skin Thickness Insulin Interaction
# Usefulness: Skin thickness and insulin levels can both be related to diabetes risk. Their interaction term can help capture this relationship.
# Input samples: 'skin': [49.0, 52.0, 46.0], 'insu': [155.0, 65.0, 0.0]
df['skin_insulin_interaction'] = df['skin'] * df['insu']
