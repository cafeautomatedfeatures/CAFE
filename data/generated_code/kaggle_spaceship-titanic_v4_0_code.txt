# Feature name: GroupSize
# Usefulness: Indicates the number of passengers traveling in the same group. Larger groups might have a higher chance of being transported together.
# Input samples: 'PassengerId': ['8878_01', '7749_02', '3955_01']

df['GroupSize'] = df['PassengerId'].str.split('_', expand=True)[0].map(group_sizes)
# Feature name: Deck
# Usefulness: Extracts the deck information from the Cabin column. Passengers on different decks might have different chances of being transported.
# Input samples: 'Cabin': ['E/568/P', 'D/244/P', 'G/648/S']
df['Deck'] = df['Cabin'].str[0]
df['Deck'] = df['Deck'].astype('category')

# Feature name: Side
# Usefulness: Extracts the side information from the Cabin column. Passengers on different sides (Port or Starboard) might have different chances of being transported.
# Input samples: 'Cabin': ['E/568/P', 'D/244/P', 'G/648/S']
