# Feature: Employment stability
# Usefulness: This feature checks if the individual has a stable employment, which can help in understanding their ability to repay the credit.
# Input samples: 'employment': [4, 0, 2]
df['employment_stability'] = df['employment'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x >= 3 else 0)

# Dropping 'employment' column as 'employment_stability' provides a more generalized representation of employment status
df.drop(columns=['employment'], inplace=True)
