# (Urea-to-calcium ratio)
# Usefulness: Urine analysis can show elevated levels of urea and calcium in patients with kidney stones. This ratio can be an indicator of the likelihood of kidney stone formation.
# Input samples: 'urea': [398.0, 178.0, 364.0], 'calc': [3.16, 3.04, 7.31]
df['urea_calc_ratio'] = df['urea'] / df['calc']
