# (Seedlot_Density)
# Usefulness: Some seedlots may be more dense than others, which could affect the growth of the trees. This feature gives an indication of the density of each seedlot.
# Input samples: 'PMCno': [1521.0, 1524.0, 1786.0], 'Ht': [13.32, 5.5, 5.39], 'DBH': [31.38, 7.6, 6.05]
df['Seedlot_Density'] = (df['Ht'] * df['DBH']) / df['PMCno']
# (Species_Survival_Rate)
# Usefulness: This feature gives an indication of the average survival rate for each species.
# Input samples: 'Sp': [6, 8, 1], 'Surv': [nan, 20.0, 88.0]
species_mean_survival = df.groupby('Sp')['Surv'].mean()
