# Feature name and description: right_moment
# Usefulness: Calculates the moment on the right side of the balance scale, which is the product of right-weight and right-distance.
# Input samples: 'right-weight': [5.0, 3.0, 1.0], 'right-distance': [2.0, 4.0, 4.0]
df['right_moment'] = df['right-weight'] * df['right-distance']
# Feature name and description: moment_difference
# Usefulness: Calculates the difference between the left and right moments, which helps to determine the tipping direction of the balance scale.
# Input samples: 'left-weight': [2.0, 4.0, 1.0], 'left-distance': [2.0, 5.0, 4.0], 'right-weight': [5.0, 3.0, 1.0], 'right-distance': [2.0, 4.0, 4.0]
df['moment_difference'] = (df['left-weight'] * df['left-distance']) - (df['right-weight'] * df['right-distance'])
# Drop the original columns as they are now represented by the moment_difference feature and may introduce multicollinearity.
df.drop(columns=['left-weight', 'left-distance', 'right-weight', 'right-distance'], inplace=True)
